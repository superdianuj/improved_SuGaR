# put the low resolution images in data/dataset as "LR" labelled
# put the high resolution images in data/dataset as "HR" labelled. For inferene, the low resolutions images can be put in "HR" folder
# place the pretrained models in "experiments" folder, as mentioned in https://github.com/Maclory/SPSR
